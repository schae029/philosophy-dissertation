PhD dissertation with abstract

Dissertation from June 2006, defended at the University of Minnesota--Twin Cities.

Since this copy of my dissertation has been converted into MS Word from another word processing program, the page numbering is not quite right.  Each chapter begins on the page number noted in the Table of Contents.  But for some of the chapters the numbering in Word runs over into the numbering of the next chapter, or comes up short of the numbering in the next chapter.  Otherwise the conversion into Word seems to have worked as hoped for.  The footnotes are the source of the problem for the conversion into Word.
